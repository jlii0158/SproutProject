    <string name="read">This is an Android-based platform application tailor-made for families with children who is able to easily query and read common plant knowledge outside of school time as well as to provide a set of entertaining planting plans to cultivate children with hands-on ability, increase the interest in acquiring knowledge, and even improve the closeness of the parent-child relationship.</string>
    <string name="read1">The target audience for this app are families with children. The expected range of age is at 12 to 15, because children of this age group are in the enlightenment stage where they begin to acquire external knowledge and become interested, but they often cannot complete a long-term job independently. Therefore, stimulating the curiosity of children of this age is the main focus and motivation of the app.</string>
    <string name="slogan">Unwilling to lonely and mediocre, the pursuit of struggle and glory.</string>
    <string name="searching">Find a plant by inputting any information of the plant, such as name, water need, harvest cycle. Then the detailed information is provided.</string>
    <string name="recognition">Recognize the plant by taking or uploading the pictures.</string>
    <string name="planning">Make your own planting plan, we will help you to record the whole process, and remind you to water on time.</string>
    <string name="medal_ins">According to your planting check-in record, when reaching a certain number, you will get the corresponding medal reward.</string>
    <string name="insectionSign">Leaves with brown spots, holes, nibbled edges or insects anywhere on the plant are sure signs of pest infestation or disease. Whilst power mildew or grey fuzzy mould on leaves attract and encourage insect infestations on the plant.</string>
    <string name="infectionSolution">Isolate the plant, remove all infected leaves, and then wipe off the insects with a damp cloth or soapy water. Application neem oil helps control pests and fungi in many houseplants because it is also an organic insecticide.</string>
    <string name="overWaterSign">Overwatered plants usually have very withered, drooping leaves, and even if they die (i.e. drown), they remain soft and pliable. This is the most common cactus, and they are often overwatered (a good rule of thumb is not to water).</string>
    <string name="overWaterSolution">Water the plants usually but less often, so that the water soaks the soil thoroughly. This will encourage stronger root growth as the plant learns that it is not watering hard enough and therefore needs to store the water it does get.</string>
    <string name="dehy">Leaves will often have brown leaf tips or edges or go “crispy” when the plant is not getting enough water. When water passes through the soil without soaking in, it also means the soil has been dried out and the plant is most likely dehydrated.</string>
    <string name="deh_solution">Increase the frequency of watering, and on your first watering, make sure to dip a handful of water or a basin into the sink thoroughly, then run the faucet in a trickle for 15 minutes. Another solution is to reassemble the plant in a larger container, as the roots may be tightly tied together and compete for space (and water).</string>
    <string name="nutrition_sign">Lack of new growth, paleness of pale green veins in new leaves, or new leaves that have never grown old or malformed, often a sign of nutrient deficiency. In the absence of nitrogen, potassium (yellowing tip and margin) and iron (yellowing leaf), most signs will appear as yellowing leaf.</string>
    <string name="nutrition_solution">Adding organic materials to the soil (such as compost or coffee grounds) also reduces pH slowly over time, extending microbial life and improving soil structure. In particular, plants with low iron content require soils with a pH below 7, which can be promoted by adding acidic mulch (such as pine needles).</string>
    <string name="sunlight_sign">Plants that are lanky, floppy, pale, are shedding leaves or have new growth that is pale and flimsy are probably not getting enough sunlight. With succulents, the plant often gets leggy where the stem grows long and the leaves become widely spread.</string>
    <string name="sunlight_solution">Some plants need direct sunlight, while others only need indirect sunlight. Figuring out the type of plant that works best for you will help you determine if you\'re getting enough. Move the plants to the windowsill, keeping the blinds open and moving the plants as little as possible, as they usually have to reorient themselves to the sun by growing new leaves.</string>
    <string name="sick_title">You must love your plants, but if they are not taken care of, they can go wrong. Maybe he was still smiling at you the day before, but he might be pale the next day, so what happened to the plants?</string>
